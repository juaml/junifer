.. _preprocess:

Preprocess
==========

Description
-----------

The ``Preprocess`` is an object meant for pre-processing before or after
:ref:`Marker <marker>` step depending on the use-case. For example, you might
want to perform confound removal on ``BOLD`` data before feature extraction.


.. note::

   This step is optional for the pipeline to work.

.. _preprocess_confounds:

Confound Removal
----------------

The *Confound Removal* step is meant to remove *confounds* from the ``BOLD``
data. The confounds are extracted from the ``BOLD_confounds`` data (must be
provided by the :ref:`Data Grabber <datagrabber>`). The confounds are then
regressed out from the ``BOLD`` data using :func:`nilearn.image.clean_img`.

Currently, junifer supports only one confound removal class:
:class:`.fMRIPrepConfoundRemover`. This class is meant to remove confounds as
described before, using the output of `fMRIPrep`_ as reference.

Strategy
~~~~~~~~

This confound remover uses the `nilearn`_ API from
:func:`nilearn.interfaces.fmriprep.load_confounds`. That is, define a *strategy*
to extract the confounds from the ``BOLD_confounds`` data. The *strategy* is
defined by choosing the *noise components* to be used and the *confounds* to be
extracted from each noise components. The *noise components* currently supported
are:

* ``motion``
* ``wm_csf``
* ``global_signal``

The confounds options for each *noise component* are:

* ``basic``: the basic confounds for each *noise component*. For example, for
  ``motion``, the basic confounds are the 6 motion parameters (3 translations
  and 3 rotations). For ``wm_csf``, the basic confounds are the mean signal of
  the white matter and CSF regions. For ``global_signal``, the basic confound
  is the mean signal of the whole brain.
* ``power2``: the basic confounds plus the square of each basic confound.
* ``derivatives``: the basic confounds plus the derivative of each basic
  confound.
* ``full``: the basic confounds, the derivative of each basic confound, the
  square of each basic confound and the square of each derivative of each basic
  confound.

The *strategy* is defined as a dictionary, with the *noise components* as keys
and the *confounds* as values.

Example in python format:

.. code-block:: python

    strategy = {
        "motion": "basic",
        "wm_csf": "full",
        "global_signal": "derivatives"
    }

or in YAML format:

.. code-block:: yaml

    strategy:
        motion: basic
        wm_csf: full
        global_signal: derivatives

The default value is to use all the *noise components* with the ``full`` *confounds*:

.. code-block:: python

    strategy = {
        "motion": "full",
        "wm_csf": "full",
        "global_signal": "full"
    }
