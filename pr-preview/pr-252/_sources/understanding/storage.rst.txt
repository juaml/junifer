Storage
=======

Description
-----------

The ``Storage`` is an object that is responsible for storing extracted features
as computed from :ref:`Marker <marker>` step of the pipeline. If the pipeline is
provided with a ``storage-like`` object, the extracted features are stored via
that object else they are kept in memory.

Storage is meant to be used inside the datagrabber context but you can operate
on them outside the context as long as the processed data is in the memory and
the Python runtime has not garbage-collected it.

The :ref:`Markers <marker>` are responsible for defining what *storage kind*
(``matrix``, ``vector``, ``timeseries``) they support for which
:ref:`data type <data_types>` by overriding its ``get_output_type`` method. The
storage object in turn declares and provides implementation for specific
*storage kind*. For example, :class:`.SQLiteFeatureStorage` supports saving
``matrix``, ``vector`` and ``timeseries`` via ``store_matrix``, ``store_vector``
and ``store_timeseries`` methods respectively.

For storage interfaces not supported by junifer yet, you can either make your
own ``Storage`` by providing a concrete implementation of
:class:`.BaseFeatureStorage` or open an issue on `junifer Github`_ and we can
help you out.
