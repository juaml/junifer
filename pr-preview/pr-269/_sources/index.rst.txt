Welcome to junifer's documentation!
===================================

junifer (JUelich NeuroImaging FEature extractoR) is a data handling and feature
extraction library targeted towards neuroimaging data specifically functional
MRI data.

It is currently being developed and maintained at the Applied Machine Learning
(`AML`_) group at Forschungszentrum Juelich, Germany. Although the library is
designed for people working at Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine - Brain
and Behaviour (`INM-7`_), it is designed to be as modular as possible thus
enabling others to extend it easily.
