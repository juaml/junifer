Getting Help
============

    | Help! I need somebody
    | Help! not just anybody
    | Help! you know I need someone
    | Help!

    -- The Beatles, Help!

This fragment of the song originally appeared in the 1965 film Help! and was written by Lennon and McCartney, just a
few years after the development of Mark 1, the first commercial computer. Maybe just a random coincidence, or maybe
Lennon was just trying to write an email to McCartney.

While the song might have been written with another meaning in mind, it is a good way to describe the situation of many
researchers who are presented with a new toolbox. Indeed, the situation of many researchers is that the projects they
are working on are becoming more and more complex in terms of methods and data. Thus, we *open up the doors* to new 
possibilites:

    | When I was younger, so much younger than today
    | I never needed anybody's help in any way
    | But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured
    | Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors

    -- The Beatles, Help!

The setback with modern reseearch is that nowaday's methods are often more complex and require more computing, which
means that we need to learn concepts from computer sciences, mathematics, statistics, etc. This is a good thing, but it
also means that we need to learn new tools and new ways of thinking, which can be a bit overwhelming, to the point that
we start relying more and more on other researchers. In the end, we might feel like we loose our independence:

    | And now my life has changed in oh so many ways
    | My independence seems to vanish in the haze
    | But every now and then I feel so insecure
    | I know that I just need you like I've never done before

    -- The Beatles, Help!

We can continue with the song, but we think you get the point. The point is that we will need help, and we will need
to ask for it. We will need to ask for help from our colleagues, from our supervisors, from our friends.

We are a small team of researchers and developers, and we are not experts in *everything at once*. Each one of us has
a specific expertise, and we are trying to use this expertise to create Junifer. When we thought of Junifer, we thought
about researcher's problems, and try to come up with the best way to help them, by building a tool that is easy to use,
that is easy to learn, and that is easy to understand. Most importantly, we are here to help. We are here to help you
and your research.

If you have any questions, if you have any problems, if you have any suggestions, please do not hesitate to contact
us. We will be happy to help you, and we will be happy to hear from you.

Seems nice, no? But we have one condition: **helps us help you**.

We are not mind readers. We cannot know what you are thinking, and we cannot know what you are trying to do. Unless you
tell us. **The more detailed explanation you give us, the faster we can help you**. So we have opened several
communication channels, so that you can contact us in the way that is most convenient for you.

Some people prefer to **write, in detail, with code and figures**. If you are one of those, use the
`junifer Discussions`_. site on GitHub. This is a place where you can ask questions, and where you can discuss topics
such as potential new features, or potential new methods.

Some other people does **not have a clear idea of what they want**, but they know that they need help. This is not a
problem, but it is a bit more difficult to help. Since it will require more frequent interactions to try to understand
what you are trying to do, we have the `junifer matrix channel`_ in which you can chat with us and other junifer users.

Finally, some people **prefer to not even leave trace of their issue in written**. If you are one of those, you might
want to join our *office hours*. Given that our agenda might vary, office hours will be announced on the
`junifer matrix channel`_ chat. Feel free to join and just *listen in* if you are too shy to write.

In short, these are the 3 communication channels to get help:

#. Discussions on Github (`junifer Discussions`_):

   * **+** You can write your question in detail.
   * **-** You need to write your question in detail.
   * **+** Your question will not get mixed with other conversations.
   * **+** Likely to be the fastest way to solve the issue in the long-run.

#. Chat (`junifer matrix channel`_):

   * **+** You can ask questions in real-time, including code and figures.
   * **-** Real-time depends on the availability of the other users.
   * **-** Conversations will mix.

#. Video Calls (*office hours*)

   * **+** You can get real-time feedback.
   * **-** We can't read or write code, or even propose solutions for you to test.
