Preprocess
==========

Description
-----------

The ``Preprocess`` step of the pipeline is meant for pre-processing before or after :ref:`Marker <marker>` step
depending on the use-case. For example, you might want to perform confound removal on ``BOLD`` data before
feature extraction.

This step is still under development and is an optional one for the pipeline to work.
