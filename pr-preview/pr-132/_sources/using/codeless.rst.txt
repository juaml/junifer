Code-less Configuration
=======================

On of the most important features of junifer is its capacity to run without
writing a single line of code. This is achieved by using a configuration file
that is written in YAML_. In this file, we configure the different steps of
:ref:`pipeline`.

As a reminder, this is how the pipeline looks like:

.. mermaid::

   flowchart LR
     dg[Data Grabber]
     dr[Data Reader]
     pp[Pre-processing]
     mc[Marker Computation]
     st[Storage]
     dg --> dr
     dr --> pp
     pp --> mc
     mc --> st


Thus, the configuration file must configure each of the sections of the pipeline,
as well as some general parameters.

As an example, we will generate the configuration file for a pipeline that will
extract the mean ``VBM_GM`` values using two different parcellations and one set
of coordinates, from the ``Oasis VBM Testing dataset`` included in junifer.


General Parameters
------------------

The general parameters are the ones that are not specific to any of the sections
of the pipeline, but configure junifer as a whole. These parameters are:

* ``with``: A section used to specify modules and junifer extensions to use.
* ``workdir``: The working directory where junifer will store temporary files.

Since the example uses a specific datagrabber for testing, we need to add
``junifer.testing.registry`` to the ``with`` section. This will allow junifer
to find the datagrabber. We will set the ``workdir`` to ``/tmp``.

.. code-block:: yaml

  with: junifer.testing.registry

  workdir: /tmp

Step-by-step Configuration
--------------------------

In order to configure the pipeline, we need to configure each step:

* ``datagrabber``
* ``datareader``
* ``preprocess``
* ``markers``
* ``storage``

.. important::

   The datareader step configuration is optional, as junifer only provides one
   datareader. Nevertheless, it is possible to extend junifer with custom
   datareaders, and thus, it is also possible to configure this step.


Data Grabber
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``datagrabber`` section must be configured using the ``kind`` key to specify
the DataGrabber to use. Additional keys correspond to the parameters of the
DataGrabber constructor.

For example, to use the :class:`.DataladAOMICPIOP1` DataGrabber, we just need to
specify its name as the ``kind`` key.

.. code-block:: yaml

  datagrabber:
    kind: DataladAOMICPIOP1

However, it is also possible to pass parameters to the DataGrabber constructor.
In this case, we can restrict the DataGrabber to fetch only the ``restingstate``
task.

.. code-block:: yaml

  datagrabber:
    kind: DataladAOMICPIOP1
    tasks: restingstate

In the ``Oasis VBM Testing dataset`` example, the section will look like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

  datagrabber:
    kind: OasisVBMTestingDataGrabber


Data Reader
^^^^^^^^^^^

As mentioned before, this section is entirely optional, as junifer only provides
one DataReader (:class:`.DefaultDataReader`), which is the default in case the
section is not specified.

In any case, the syntax of the section is the same as for the ``datagrabber``
section, using the ``kind`` key to specify the DataReader to use, and additional
keys to pass parameters to the DataReader constructor:

.. code-block:: yaml

    datareader:
      kind: DefaultDataReader


For the ``Oasis VBM Testing dataset`` example, we will not specify a
``datareader`` step.

Preprocess
^^^^^^^^^^

Pre-processing is also an optional step, as it might be the case that no
pre-processing is needed. In the case that pre-processing is needed, the section
must be configured using the ``kind`` key to specify the preprocessor to use,
and additional keys to pass parameters to the preprocessor.

For example, to use the :class:`.fMRIPrepConfoundRemover` preprocessor, we just
need to specify its name as the ``kind`` key, as well as its parameters.

.. code-block:: yaml

  preprocess:
    kind: fMRIPrepConfoundRemover
    strategy:
      motion: full
      wm_csf: full
      global_signal: basic
    spike: 0.2
    detrend: false
    standardize: true


For the ``Oasis VBM Testing dataset`` example, we will not specify a
preprocessing step.


Marker
^^^^^^

The ``markers`` section diverges from the previous ones, as we need to specify
a list of markers. Each marker has a name that we can use to refer to it later,
and a set of parameters that will be passed to the marker.

For the ``Oasis VBM Testing dataset`` example, we want to compute the mean
``VBM_GM`` value for each parcel using the ``Schaefer parcellation (100 parcels,
7 networks)``, ``Schaefer parcellation (200 parcels, 7 networks)``, and the
``DMNBuckner`` network, using ``5mm`` spheres. Thus, we will configure the
``markers`` section as follows:

.. code-block:: yaml

  markers:
    - name: Schaefer100x7_mean
      kind: ParcelAggregation
      parcellation: Schaefer100x7
      method: mean
    - name: Schaefer200x7_mean
      kind: ParcelAggregation
      parcellation: Schaefer200x7
      method: mean
    - name: DMNBuckner_5mm_mean
      kind: SphereAggregation
      coords: DMNBuckner
      radius: 5
      method: mean


Storage
^^^^^^^

Finally, we need to define how and where the results will be stored. This is
done using the ``storage`` section, which must be configured using the ``kind``
key to specify the storage to use, and additional keys to pass parameters.

For example, to use the :class:`.SQLiteFeatureStorage` storage, we just need to
specify where we want to store the results:

.. code-block:: yaml

    storage:
      kind: SQLiteFeatureStorage
      uri: /data/junifer/example/oasis_vbm_testing.sqlite


Complete Example
----------------

This is how the full ``Oasis VBM Testing dataset`` example configuration file
looks like:

.. code-block:: yaml

  with: junifer.testing.registry

  workdir: /tmp

  datagrabber:
    kind: OasisVBMTestingDataGrabber

  markers:
    - name: Schaefer100x7_mean
      kind: ParcelAggregation
      parcellation: Schaefer100x7
      method: mean
    - name: Schaefer200x7_mean
      kind: ParcelAggregation
      parcellation: Schaefer200x7
      method: mean
    - name: DMNBuckner_5mm_mean
      kind: SphereAggregation
      coords: DMNBuckner
      radius: 5
      method: mean

  storage:
    kind: SQLiteFeatureStorage
    uri: /data/junifer/example/oasis_vbm_testing.sqlite
