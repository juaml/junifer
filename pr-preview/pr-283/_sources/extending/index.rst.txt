Extending junifer
=================

While we aim to provide as many datasets and markers as possible, we are also
interested in allowing users to extend the functionality with their own
datagrabbers, preprocessing, markers, etc., .

It's not necessary to have the new functionality included in junifer before
the user can use them. The user can simply create a new Python file, code the
desired functionality and use it with junifer. This is the first step towards
including the new functionality in the junifer pipeline.

In this section we will show how to extend junifer, by creating new
datagrabbers, preprocessing, markers, etc.,  following the *junifer* way.
